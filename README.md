# Nonprofit Advertiser Transparency Project

## Overview

This project aims to increase transparency around the funding sources of nonprofit advertisers, revealing who financially supports these entities. By analyzing public tax files and scraping web data, we identify key backers of these nonprofits.

## Files

1. **Analyze Tax File.ipynb**: Extracts key financial data from IRS Form 990 XML files for nonprofits.
2. **Scrape Web Data from Propublica.ipynb**: Uses web scraping to gather data on the financial connections of nonprofits from ProPublica's Nonprofit Explorer.

## Output

Both notebooks output CSV files detailing the financial relationships and supporters of the targeted nonprofits.

## Usage

Run the notebooks using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to generate the data files.
